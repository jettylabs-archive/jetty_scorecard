You have the following row access policies in your environment:
<ul>
    {% for policy in policy_names|sort %}
    <li>{{ policy }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

You can run Jetty Scorecard again using a role that can access <code>SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.POLICY_REFERENCES</code>
to check if all of these polices have been successfully applied in at least one location. You can also check this
manually by running
<code>"SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.POLICY_REFERENCES WHERE policy_kind = 'ROW_ACCESS_POLICY'</code>.
